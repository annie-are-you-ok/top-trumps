# top-trumps
Star Wars top trumps game using an API - https://swapi.dev/api/planets/

During an intro to Python course, i got to play with and create a Pokemon top trumps game as part of the course. This was my attempt at using what i had learnt to create my own game using a different API and writing the code from scratch/myself. 

i was also able to extend it by;
        - adding a for loop to create 3 'rounds'
        - setting up a scoring system so that a winner could be named after the 3 rounds
        - adding a play again function
        - converting any 'unknown' results for my 3 stats to the integer 0 so that an, eg, unknown population would lose to a population of 100, rather than the unkown winning or breaking the code.

Part of the struggle/learning curve was also learning to read and understand the API's documentation, figuring out where certains bits of code needed to go, and then adding the code to GitHub.
